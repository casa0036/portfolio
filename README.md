# My Portfolio

The process that I took to create my portfolio was I began with creating the files needed in my repo and importing all the assets that will be used within the website. Then I started laying out the basic structure of my webpage. I then created all the elements that are the same on every page like the navigation, footer and other HTML tags that will be on every page. I also linked all the style sheets and the internal/external links on the webpage, this helps to ensure that all of this is working as it should be. After adding all of the basic HTML I started adding all the content to each page and adding all the sections needed in each main tag. With all the content on the pages and all of the styling with bootstraps, I started styling in the CSS stylesheet. I changed all the default colours from bootstraps and this is also when I added the animate.style to the HTML and CSS. After all this was done I tested my webpage to ensure it passed the checks. 

Some challenges that I faced in the making of this project included the limits of using bootstraps. With using bootstraps for most of the layout and CSS styling, I ran into a lot of problems in trying to create what I wanted. I had to change a lot of things from my original layout because it was not possible to get it exact with bootstraps. I also ran into problems with accessibility and had to change some of my colours from the original to be web-compliant. 

I overcame a lot of these challenges by just doing more research on the certain tools I was using or just compromising and changing the design to work better.
